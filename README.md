# Face Recognition using CNN Architectures
This project explores deep learning-based face recognition using various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. It focuses on classification performance, data handling, and real-world applicability through enhanced model training and evaluation techniques.

## üîç Overview
Developed a custom web scraper to collect facial image data.

Applied data augmentation to diversify the dataset and improve model generalization.

Implemented and compared multiple deep learning models:

- AlexNet

- DenseNet121

- VGG19

- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Experimented with optimization strategies like Adam and SGD.

Introduced an "unknown" class to handle unrecognized faces, improving real-world usability.

Evaluated performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

## üöÄ Key Achievements
